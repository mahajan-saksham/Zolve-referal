## Sparkle/Decorative Elements

"Create a set of modern, minimal decorative elements that can be used throughout the Zolve referral page to add visual interest without overwhelming the content. These should include:

1. A simple sparkle or star shape in Zolve's coral/orange (#FF6B44) that can be used to highlight important information

2. A subtle pattern of geometric shapes (circles, triangles, soft squares) that can be used as background elements, primarily in light gray or very light blue

3. Thin, elegant divider lines with small decorative endpoints in Zolve's brand colors

4. Small confetti-like shapes in Zolve's color palette that can be used to create celebration moments around referral rewards

All elements should be vector-based for easy scaling, with clean lines and minimal detail that aligns with Zolve's modern, professional aesthetic. The elements should be subtle enough to complement rather than compete with the primary content."
